              <span>After over 4.5 years, we&rsquo;re sad to say that Cards for Humanity shut down on May 25, 2018. Together, we&rsquo;ve
                donated $746 to the Make-A-Wish foundation. We&rsquo;re proud to have been part of this amazing adventure
                and of all the excitement around this site over the years. Thanks to everyone who played and a special thanks
                to
                <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/cfhio/fundraiser/cards4humanity">everyone who donated through our site</a>.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <dt>Wait. You shut down on May 25, 2018? Is it because of the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Well, yes and no. We were going to have to shut down eventually anyway. It costs money to keep the server
                  running all these years and due to the Creative Commons license of the cards themselves, we can&rsquo;t
                  accept any donations for the purposes of paying for the server, so there&rsquo;s no way this was going
                  to be sustainable anyway. GDPR is just a convenient excuse since it&rsquo;d involve having to do extra
                  work on a site at a time when the four of us are busy with our own commitments. After 4.5 years, we think
                  Cards for Humanity has run its course.</dd>

                <dt>What happened to all my data?</dt>
                <dd>We&rsquo;ve deleted all of it (including backups). We&rsquo;ve never shared it or granted anyone else access
                to that data.</dd>
              </li>
              <li>
                <dt>Is it too late to donate?</dt>
                <dd>Not at all! If you&rsquo;d like to donate to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, you can do so
                <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/donate/project/cfhio/cards4humanity">here</a>.</dd>
              </li>
              <li>
                <dt>Can I keep playing?</dt>
                <dd>Sure! Just not on our site. You can buy the original cards from
                <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a>, or check out other online Cards Against Humanity games, like
                <a href="http://pyx-3.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/">Pretend You&#39;re Xyzzy</a>. They&rsquo;re obviously not as pretty as us, but we can&rsquo;t all be perfect.</dd>
              </li>
              <li>
                <dt>What if I&rsquo;m really good with computers and know how to spin up my own server?</dt>
                <dd>The source code for our project is still available on
                <a href="https://github.com/cardsforhumanity/cardsforhumanity">Github</a>.
                That code has remained largely untouched since late 2013, so keep that in mind and proceed at your own risk.</dd>
              </li>
              <li>
                <dt>Will you guys ever bring this back?</dt>
                <dd>It&rsquo;s probably not going to happen, unless our friends at Cards Against Humanity decide to throw money
                at us to make it happen instead of, say, buying
                <a href="http://hawaii2.website/">another Hawaii</a>.
                (We&rsquo;d say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never going to happen,&rdquo; but that kinda blew up in our face the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump">last time we said that</a>.)</dd>
